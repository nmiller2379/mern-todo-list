# Todo List Application - User Stories

### User Stories

#### 1. **Homepage Introduction**
   - **As a user**, I want to see a simple welcome message on the homepage with a brief description of the app, so I understand its purpose.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: When I visit the homepage, I see a welcome message and links/buttons to view my todo list or add a new todo.

#### 2. **Viewing Todos**
   - **As a user**, I want to view a list of all my todos on the "List" page, so I can see my pending tasks.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: When I visit the "List" page, I see a list of todos with clear titles and any status indicators (e.g., completed or not completed).

#### 3. **Adding a New Todo**
   - **As a user**, I want to add a new todo item on the "Add Todo" page, so I can keep track of new tasks.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: When I visit the "Add Todo" page, I can enter a title and description, submit it, and see it appear on the "List" page.

#### 4. **Marking a Todo as Complete**
   - **As a user**, I want to mark a todo as completed, so I know which tasks I have finished.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: On the "List" page, each todo has a button or checkbox to mark it as complete. When I mark a todo as complete, its appearance changes to indicate completion, and the status persists across sessions.

#### 5. **Deleting a Todo**
   - **As a user**, I want to delete a todo if I no longer need it, so my list remains up-to-date.

#### 6. **Persistent Data**
   - **As a user**, I want my todos to be saved even if I refresh the page or log in on another device, so my list is always accessible.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All todos are stored in a database and persist across page reloads and sessions.
